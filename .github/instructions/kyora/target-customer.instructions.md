**Purpose**: Deep understanding of who we serve — guides UX decisions, feature prioritization, content tone, i18n phrasing.

**When to use**: Designing new features, writing UI copy, prioritizing roadmap, evaluating product decisions.

## 1. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Demographics

| Attribute     | Value                                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Age           | 25–45 years old                                                          |
| Gender        | Predominantly women (70%+), but mixed                                    |
| Location      | Middle East (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, Kuwait, Jordan)                   |
| Language      | Arabic-first (many bilingual, but prefer Arabic)                         |
| Education     | High school to university (not specialized business training)            |
| Device        | Smartphone-heavy (80%+ of interactions on mobile)                        |
| Tech literacy | Low to moderate (comfortable with Instagram, less with "business tools") |

### Business Profile

| Attribute          | Value                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Business type      | Solo entrepreneur, side hustle, home-based          |
| Team size          | Solo or 2–5 people (often family/friends)           |
| Sales channels     | Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok, Facebook DMs           |
| Product categories | Handmade goods, fashion, beauty, food, resold items |
| Order volume       | 10–200 orders/month (growth stage)                  |
| Revenue            | $500–$10,000/month                                  |
| Registration       | Often informal (unregistered), formalize later      |

### Context

- **Time-poor**: Juggling production, selling, delivery, family responsibilities
- **Resource-constrained**: Limited budget for tools, no dedicated admin staff
- **Fear complexity**: Avoid "proper business tools" (too complicated, too expensive, feel "not for me")
- **Relationship-driven**: Selling via personal connections, DMs, word-of-mouth
- **Cash-based**: Many transactions are cash-on-delivery (COD), some bank transfers

---

## 2. Psychographics

### Mindset

**What they believe**:

- "I'm good at selling and making products" (confident in core skill)
- "I don't know how to 'do business properly'" (fear of business/accounting knowledge gap)
- "I might be losing money and not know it" (anxiety about unseen problems)
- "Big business tools are not for people like me" (impostor syndrome)

**What they want**:

- To feel professional (even if small)
- To be in control (know what's happening)
- To avoid mistakes (embarrassment, financial loss)
- To focus on selling (not admin chaos)

**What they fear**:

- Complexity (too many fields, confusing terms)
- Making mistakes (messing up finances, taxes)
- Feeling stupid (being exposed as "not knowing business")
- Wasting time (learning tools that don't fit their workflow)

### Motivations

| Motivation         | What it drives                                             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Financial security | Need to know: Am I making money? Can I pay bills?          |
| Professional pride | Want to look/feel legit (not amateurish)                   |
| Growth ambition    | Dream of scaling up (but need foundation first)            |
| Family support     | Often supporting household, needs reliable income tracking |
| Community respect  | Reputation matters in tight-knit seller communities        |

## 3. Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

### Primary Job

**When** I'm running a small business through Instagram/WhatsApp DMs,  
**I want to** know I'm not losing money or missing orders,  
**So I can** feel in control and focus on selling (not admin chaos).

### Supporting Jobs

| Job                     | Trigger                                | Desired outcome                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Track orders            | Customer sends DM order                | Order recorded, status clear              |
| Manage inventory        | Worried about running out of stock     | Know what's low, what to restock          |
| Understand finances     | End of month, need to know profit      | See profit, cash in hand (plain language) |
| Prepare for taxes       | Tax season approaching                 | Records ready, no panic                   |
| Coordinate with helpers | Family member/friend helps with orders | Shared access, clear responsibilities     |

### Jobs They Avoid (Anti-Jobs)

- "Learn accounting" (feels irrelevant, intimidating)
- "Set up complex systems" (no time, no patience)
- "Migrate from current mess" (too much work, afraid to break things)

**Design implication**: Onboarding must be gradual, data entry fast, migration optional.

## 6. Iceberg Model (Visible vs Hidden Needs)

### Visible Needs (What They Ask For)

- "I need to track my orders"
- "I need to manage my inventory"
- "I need to know my profit"

### Hidden Needs (What They Really Want)

- **Feel smart** (not stupid for not knowing business)
- **Avoid shame** (fear of being exposed as disorganized)
- **Build confidence** (progress from chaos to control)
- **Simplify overwhelming reality** (life is chaotic, business should feel handled)

**Design implication**: UI must be **confidence-building**, not intimidating. Celebrate progress, don't expose chaos.

## 7. Consumer Insight (The Truth We Build On)

> "I'm good at selling and making products, but I don't know how to track everything. I worry I'm losing money or messing up, and I don't want to feel stupid trying to 'do business properly.' I just want someone to quietly keep things organized and tell me what matters."

**What this means for product**:

1. **Don't make them "learn business"** → Automate the business mechanics
2. **Don't make them feel stupid** → Use plain language, no judgment
3. **Tell them what matters** → Proactive insights, "What to do next"

**This insight drives every product decision.**

## 11. Decision-Making Guidance

When evaluating features or UX decisions, ask:

### ICP Test
