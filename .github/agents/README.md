# Kyora Custom Agents

Custom GitHub Copilot agents tailored for Kyora's development workflows. These agents are specialized for building production-ready features across Kyora's full stack (Go backend + React frontend) with a focus on multi-tenancy, RTL/Arabic-first UX, and social commerce workflows.

## Available Agents

### 🏗️ **Feature Builder** (Most Common)

**Use when**: Building complete features from backend to frontend

The orchestrator agent that builds end-to-end features by coordinating between specialists. Handles everything from database models to UI components, ensuring consistency across the stack.

**Invokes**: Backend Specialist, Portal-Web Specialist  
**Best for**: "Add expense tracking feature", "Build customer loyalty program", "Implement discount codes"

---

### 🔧 **Backend Specialist**

**Use when**: Implementing backend-only features or fixing backend issues

Go backend expert specializing in domain-driven design, GORM/Postgres, multi-tenancy, Stripe/Resend integration, and E2E testing with testcontainers.

**Best for**: "Add API endpoint for bulk imports", "Fix order state machine", "Implement recurring billing"

---

### 🎨 **Portal-Web Specialist**

**Use when**: Building frontend-only features or fixing UI issues

React 19 + TanStack stack expert specializing in mobile-first, RTL/Arabic-first UI with daisyUI, Chart.js visualizations, and i18n.

**Best for**: "Create analytics dashboard", "Fix mobile layout issues", "Add Arabic date formatting"

---

### 🏛️ **Domain Architect** (Planning Phase)

**Use when**: Designing new domains before implementation

Plans domain architecture, data models, API contracts, state machines, and integration points. Creates comprehensive specs for other agents to implement.

**Best for**: "Design subscription management domain", "Plan multi-warehouse inventory", "Architect loyalty points system"

**⚠️ Manual activation required**: Set `infer: false`

---

### 🧪 **E2E Test Specialist**

**Use when**: Writing comprehensive backend tests

Testcontainers expert who writes E2E tests covering complete workflows, multi-tenancy isolation, business rules, and integration flows.

**Best for**: "Add tests for order workflow", "Test multi-tenancy isolation", "Cover error scenarios for payments"

---

### 🔍 **SSOT Auditor** (Code Quality)

**Use when**: Checking code compliance with instruction files

Audits codebase for pattern violations, instruction drift, missing documentation, and SSOT integrity. Generates comprehensive audit reports.

**Best for**: "Audit multi-tenancy scoping", "Check forms compliance", "Find undocumented patterns"

**⚠️ Manual activation required**: Set `infer: false`

---

### 🤖 **AI Architect** (Infrastructure)

**Use when**: Maintaining Copilot AI customization layer

Maintains `.github/` AI infrastructure (agents, instructions, prompts, skills). Keeps instructions synced with codebase reality.

**Best for**: "Update backend instructions", "Fix instruction drift", "Create new instruction file"

**⚠️ Manual activation required**: Set `infer: false`

## Agent Design Philosophy

### 1. Specialization Over Generalization

Each agent has a narrow, well-defined scope. This prevents confusion and ensures expertise.

### 2. Orchestration Pattern

Feature Builder delegates to specialists rather than doing everything itself. This maintains separation of concerns.

### 3. Instruction-First

All agents reference `.github/instructions/` files as SSOT. They implement what's documented, not what they "think" is best.

### 4. Production-Ready Code

No TODOs, no FIXMEs, no "example" code. Everything is complete and ready for production.

### 5. Context-Aware

Agents understand Kyora's unique context:

- Arabic-first, RTL-native UX
- Multi-tenancy (workspace + business)
- Social commerce workflows (DM-driven orders)
- Mobile-heavy users with low tech literacy

---

## How Agents Work Together

### Example: Building "Discount Codes" Feature

**Step 1: Planning (optional)**

```
@Domain-Architect Design discount codes domain with percentage/fixed amount types,
usage limits, expiry dates, and order integration
```

Output: Comprehensive design doc

**Step 2: Implementation**

```
@Feature-Builder Implement discount codes feature based on design doc
```

Feature Builder automatically:

1. Invokes `@Backend-Specialist` to create domain module + API
2. Invokes `@Portal-Web-Specialist` to create UI + forms
3. Coordinates E2E testing
4. Verifies multi-tenancy + plan gates
5. Ensures frontend/backend consistency

**Step 3: Testing (if more coverage needed)**

```
@E2E-Test-Specialist Add edge case tests for discount code stacking and expiry
```

**Step 4: Audit (before merging)**

```
@SSOT-Auditor Audit discount codes implementation for multi-tenancy and pattern compliance
```

---

## Tool Scoping

Each agent has carefully scoped tool access:

- **Read-only agents** (Domain Architect, SSOT Auditor): `read`, `search`, `grep_search`, `semantic_search`, `usages`
- **Implementation agents** (Backend/Portal-Web Specialist): + `edit`, `multi_replace`, `get_errors`
- **Orchestrator** (Feature Builder): + `agent` (for runSubagent)
- **AI Infrastructure** (AI Architect): Limited to `.github/**` paths

This prevents agents from accidentally modifying code outside their scope.

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do

- **Use Feature Builder for new features** - It orchestrates everything correctly
- **Let agents reference instructions** - They know where to look
- **Provide business context** - Explain the "why", not just the "what"
- **Review agent output** - Especially for complex features
- **Use Domain Architect for complex domains** - Design before implementing
- **Run SSOT Auditor before big PRs** - Catch violations early

### ❌ Don't

- **Don't micro-manage agents** - Let them follow their patterns
- **Don't mix agent scopes** - Use the right agent for the job
- **Don't skip testing** - E2E Test Specialist exists for a reason
- **Don't ignore audit reports** - SSOT violations accumulate into tech debt
- **Don't modify AI infrastructure without AI Architect** - Let it maintain consistency

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent not activating automatically

**Cause**: `infer: false` or unclear prompt

**Solution**: Manually select agent from dropdown, or rephrase prompt with more context

---

### Agent doing too much / too little

**Cause**: Wrong agent selected for the task

**Solution**: Check decision tree above and use appropriate agent

---

### Agent output violates patterns

**Cause**: Instruction drift or missing instruction file

**Solution**:

1. Run `@SSOT-Auditor` to find violations
2. Use `@AI-Architect` to update instructions
3. Re-run implementation agent

---

### Backend and frontend not aligned

**Cause**: Using specialists separately instead of Feature Builder

**Solution**: Always use Feature Builder for full-stack features
